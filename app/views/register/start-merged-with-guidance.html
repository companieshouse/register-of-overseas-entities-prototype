      <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Register of Overseas Entities</a> has come into force in the UK through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Overseas entities must register with Companies House and tell us who their registrable beneficial owners or managing officers are, so that they can buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK. Overseas entities who already own land in the UK will have until XX/XX/XX to register their beneficial owners or managing officers.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">After registering, the overseas entity will get a unique Overseas Entity ID number to give to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry" class="govuk-link">Land Registry</a> when it buys, sells or transfers UK property or land.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">This will lead to more transparency, which will allow law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious wealth more effectively.</p>

      {{ govukWarningText({
        text: "Beneficial owners and managing officers who do not register could be fined up to £2,500 per day, be put in prison for up to X years, and will not be able to buy or sell UK property or land.",

      }) }}
      <h3 id="what-an-overseas-entity-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What an overseas entity is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This is a legal entity, such as a company or organisation, that is governed by the law of a country or territory outside the UK.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#" class="govuk-link">Read the guidance about overseas entities</a></p>


      <h3 id="what-a-beneficial-owner-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What a beneficial owner is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">A beneficial owner is any legal body that has significant influence or control over the overseas entity. It can be:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an individual person </li>
        <li>an other legal entity </li>
        <li>a government or public authority </li>
        <li>a trustee of a trust </li>
        <li>a member of a firm that is not a legal person under its governing law </li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’ll need to give us details for any registrable beneficial owners that meet one or more of the conditions known as the <a href="https://ewf.companieshouse.gov.uk/help/en/stdwf/natureOfControlHelp.html" class="govuk-link">natures of control</a>.</p>

Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017. They can be an individual or a corporate entity, such as a financial institution or legal professional.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Agent assurance code</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The UK-regulated agent will need to <a href="/register/guidance-code" class="govuk-link">request an agent assurance code from Companies House</a>. This confirms that the agent has carried out identity checks. We cannot register an overseas entity without a code.  </p>
