      <h3 id="background" class="govuk-heading-m">What the Register of Overseas Entities is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Register of Overseas Entities has come into force in the UK through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Overseas entities must register with Companies House and tell us who their registrable beneficial owners or managing officers are, so that they can buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Overseas entities that already own land in England, Wales and Scotland will have until [transition period deadline date] to register their beneficial owners or managing officers. Entities that have disposed of property or land after 28 February 2022 will also need to register.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Entities that only owned property or land in Northern Ireland before 28 February 2022 do not need to register. They only need to register if it was bought after this date.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">After registering, the overseas entity will get a unique Overseas Entity ID to give to the Land Registry when it buys, sells or transfers UK property or land.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">This will lead to more transparency, which will allow law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious wealth more effectively.</p>

      {{ govukWarningText({
        text: "Beneficial owners and managing officers who do not register could be fined up to £2,500 per day, be put in prison for up to 5 years, and will not be able to buy or sell UK property or land.",

      <h3 id="what-an-overseas-entity-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What an overseas entity is</h3>

      <h3 id="what-a-beneficial-owner-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What a beneficial owner is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">A beneficial owner is any legal body that has significant influence or control over the overseas entity. It can be:</p>

        <li>an individual person </li>
        <li>an other legal entity </li>
        <li>a government or public authority </li>
        <li>a trustee of a trust </li>
        <li>a member of a firm that is not a legal person under its governing law </li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Updating information on the register</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The overseas entity must file an annual update one year after it was registered, and every year after that.
