      <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="govuk-link">Register of Overseas Entities</a> has come into force in the UK through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022. Overseas entities must register with Companies House and tell us who their beneficial owners or managing officers are, so that they can buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">After registering, the details of the overseas entity and its beneficial owners will be publicly available on the online register.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">This will lead to more transparency, which will allow law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious wealth more effectively.</p>
