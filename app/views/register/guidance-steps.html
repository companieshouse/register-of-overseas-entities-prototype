      <h3 id="what" class="govuk-heading-m">You are the agent and you are registering for an overseas entity online</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will be doing identity checks and registering via our online service</p>


  <ol class="govuk-body govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>Read the guidance and gather all data required</li>
    <li>Check if someone in your organisation has already requested an assurance code, if yes then skip to 6.</li>
    <li>Download the assurance code request form (one code per organisation)</li>
    <li>Email Companies House the completed assurance code request form</li>
    <li>Companies House emails you your organisation’s assurance code (do not share outside of your organisation)</li>
    <li>Complete the identity checks (see our guidance)</li>
    <li>Register the overseas entity and confirm identity checks information</li>
    <li>Once registered, you will receive an automatic response email with your application number</li>
    <li>Companies House emails you to confirm if the registration is successful</li>
  </ol>




      <h3 id="who" class="govuk-heading-m">Who needs a code</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">UK-regulated agents that are completing the identity checks need a code.
They must be based in the UK and supervised under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017. They can be individuals or corporate entities, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>credit institutions</li>
  <li>financial institutions</li>
  <li>auditors, insolvency practitioners, external accountants and tax advisers</li>
  <li>independent legal professionals</li>
  <li>trust or company service providers</li>
  <li>estate agents and letting agents</li>
</ul>

      <h3 id="get" class="govuk-heading-m">How to get a code</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to complete the 'Request an agent assurance code' document and email it to <a href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk?subject=Assurance code" class="govuk-link">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>. Put ‘Agent assurance code’ in the subject line. This will help us to process your request more quickly.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="/public/docs/Request-an-agent-assurance-code-new.odt" class="govuk-link download-icon">Download 'Request an agent assurance code'</a> <span class="file-format-size govuk-body-s">(ODT, 9KB)</span></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A Companies House examiner will check the document. If the request is accepted, they will email your code within a few working days. They may email you if there are any issues with the information you’ve provided.</p>

      <h3 id="how" class="govuk-heading-m">How to use the code</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re carrying out identity checks and registering the overseas entity, you’ll need to enter the code as part of the <a href="/register/start-merged-with-guidance" class="govuk-link">Register an overseas entity and tell us about its beneficial owners service</a>. </p>


      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to use the code if you are only carrying out identity checks</h4>

      <p class="govuk-body">If someone else is registering the overseas entity, such as someone who works for the entity, you’ll need to complete and sign a statement that confirms the identity checks have been carried out. You’ll need to provide the code as part of this statement.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="/public/docs/Overseas-entity-ID-checks-statement.odt" class="govuk-link download-icon">Download 'Overseas entity identity checks statement'</a> <span class="file-format-size govuk-body-s">(ODT, 13KB)</span></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">After the overseas entity has submitted its registration, you’ll have 14 days to email this statement to <a href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>. Put 'Overseas entity ID checks statement' in the subject line. This will help us to process the registration more quickly.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll check the statement and the application to register an overseas entity. If there are any issues with the information provided, we may email you. </p>
