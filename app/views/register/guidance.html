      <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Register of Overseas Entities</a> has come into force in the UK through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Overseas entities must register with Companies House and tell us who their registrable beneficial owners or managing officers are, so that they can buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK. Overseas entities who already own land in the UK will have until XX/XX/XX to register their beneficial owners or managing officers.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">After registering, the overseas entity will get a unique Overseas Entity ID number to give to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry" class="govuk-link">Land Registry</a> when it buys, sells or transfers UK property or land.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">This will lead to more transparency, which will allow law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious wealth more effectively.</p>

      {{ govukWarningText({
        text: "Beneficial owners and managing officers who do not register could be fined up to £2,500 per day, be put in prison for up to X years, and will not be able to buy or sell UK property or land.",
