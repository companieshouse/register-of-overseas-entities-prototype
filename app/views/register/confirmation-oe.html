      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We'll send an email to <strong>sarahphilips@sugar.com</strong> to let you know if your application to register an overseas entity has been accepted or rejected. We'll process the application as soon as possible, however we're not able to tell you exactly how long this will take.</p>

      <p>If the application is accepted, the overseas entity and its beneficial owners will be added to the <a href="javascript:void(0);">Register of Overseas Entities.</a></p>

        <p>If it's rejected, we'll explain what to do next in the email. We'll also refund the £X fee.</p>

      <p>We will send the Overseas Entity ID to <strong>janesmith@sugarhotel.com</strong>. This will need to be provided to the Land Registry whenever the overseas entity buys, sells or transfers land or property in the UK. </p><p>We'll also use this email address to send the authentication code to file online for this entity in the future.</p>
