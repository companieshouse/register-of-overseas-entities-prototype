      <h3 id="what" class="govuk-heading-m">What an assurance code is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">An assurance code is the equivalent of a signature. It confirms that the UK-regulated professional has carried out identity checks on an overseas entity.  </p>


      <h3 id="who" class="govuk-heading-m">Who needs a code</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">UK-regulated professionals that are completing the identity checks need a code.
They must be based in the UK and supervised under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017. They can be an individual or a corporate entity, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>credit institutions</li>
  <li>financial institutions</li>
  <li>auditors, insolvency practitioners, external accountants and tax advisers</li>
  <li>independent legal professionals</li>
  <li>trust or company service providers</li>
  <li>estate agents and letting agents</li>
</ul>


      <h3 id="get" class="govuk-heading-m">How to get a code</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Use the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="govuk-link">Request an assurance code document</a> to get a code. Then email it to <a href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk?subject=Assurance code" class="govuk-link">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> with ‘Assurance code’ in the subject line. This will help us to process your request more quickly.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">A Companies House examiner will check the document. If the request is accepted, they will email your code within a few working days. They may email you if any there are any issues with the information you’ve provided.</p>








      <h3 id="how" class="govuk-heading-m">How to use the code</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re carrying out identity checks and registering the overseas entity, you’ll need to enter the code as part of the <a href="/register/start-merged-with-guidance" class="govuk-link">Register an overseas entity and tell us about its beneficial owners service</a>. </p>

      </ul>



      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to use the code if you are only carrying out identity checks</h4>

      <p class="govuk-body">If someone else is registering the overseas entity, such as someone who works for the entity, you’ll need to complete and sign a document that confirms the identity checks have been carried out. You’ll need to provide the code as part of this document.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">After the overseas entity has submitted its registration, you’ll have X working days to email this document to <a href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>. Include the 18 digit application reference number in the subject line. This will be in the confirmation email that is sent to the person who registers the overseas entity. This will help us to process the registration more quickly.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll check the document and the application to register an overseas entity. If there are any issues with the information, we may email you. </p>
