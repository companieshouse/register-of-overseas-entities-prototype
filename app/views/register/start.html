<p>Use this service to add an overseas entity and its beneficial owners or managing officers to the Register of Overseas Entities. This will allow it to buy and sell land or property in the UK.</p>

      <p>You'll need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to sign in to or create a Companies House account</li>
        <li>a credit or debit card to pay the £X fee</li>
        <li>to give us the name and email address of someone we can contact about the application</li>
      </ul>
